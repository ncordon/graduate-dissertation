 We propose the following lines of further development for the package:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Keep improving the library, porting the relevant parts to C++ wherever
 possible. Objective for following months is inference part of the package.
 \item Completely split the C++ from the R part, use it as a backend for both the R 
 package and a forseeable Python package.
 \item Certain algorithms could be further improved. e.g. pow of a matrix, where we 
 could use Strassen method. The former is $\mathcal{O}(m^{2.81})$ in algorithmic 
 complexity, where $m$ is the number of states of the Markov chain. That would make 
 reachability matrix computation $\mathcal{O}(m^{2.81} \log(m))$. It could be combined 
 with "bits packing" and the use of \texttt{AND} operator
 $(A \otimes B)_{i,j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{m/64} \bigg(a_{ik} \textrm{ AND } b_{kj}\bigg)$
 to reduce hidden constants.
 \item Try to write an article for Journal of Statistical Software, a Q1 (in Software 
 and in Statistics and Probability categories) open access journal which publishes papers
 for sofware with highly mathematical foundation.
 \end{itemize}
