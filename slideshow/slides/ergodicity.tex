    \begin{definition}
    We say that a Markov chain is ergodic (or irreducible) iff all states communicate 
    with each other
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
    We say that a Markov chain is regular iff there exists some power of its transition 
    matrix with all positive elements
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
    Every regular Markov chain is also ergodic. The opposite does not hold.
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{lemma}
    Given \(P_{m\times m}\) regular, then \(P^n\) is regular for every \(n\in \naturals\)
    \end{lemma}
    
    \begin{definition}
    Given \(P\) a regular matrix, we will call \(\gamma(P) = \min\{n \in \naturals: P^n > 0\}\)
    \end{definition}
    
    \begin{theorem}
    If \(P_{m\times m}\) is regular and the shortest cycle in \(G(P)\) has length 
    \(s\), then \(\gamma(P) \le m + s(m - 2)\), and \(A^{m + s(m - 2)} > 0\).
    \end{theorem}
\end{frame}

    \begin{corollary}
    \(P_{m \times m}\) is regular iff \(P^{m^2 - 2m + 2} > 0\)
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{lemma}
    If \(P_{m \times m}\) is ergodic and has some \(1 \le d \le m\) diagonal entries 
    strictly positive, then \(P\) is regular and \(\gamma(P) \le 2m - d - 1\)
    \end{lemma}
    
    \begin{definition}
    We call steady state to a probability row vector \(v\) such that \(vP = v\)
    \end{definition}
    
    \begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem for ergodic Markov chains]

    If \(P_{m\times m}\) is an ergodic transition matrix, then there exists a unique steady state \(w\) with all its
    elements strictly positive. Moreover, every left eigenvector \(r: rP = r\) is linearly dependent of \(w\), and
    every right eigenvector \(c: Pc = c\) is a multiple of \(\onecol\).

    \label{th:steady-ergodic}
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{lemma}
    An ergodic stochastic matrix \(P_{m \times m}\) has a unique steady state \(w\) that can be computed as the
    only solution of the system:

    \[
    \twopartsys{(I - P^t)w}{0}{\onerow \cdot w}{1}
    \]

    \end{lemma}
