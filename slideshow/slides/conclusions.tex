 \vspace{2em}\fontsize{10pt}{0}\selectfont
 The main values of this work have been:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Open knowledge}: CC licensed dissertation publicly hosted at GitHub and contributions to open source software publicly available at the official R repository, CRAN for users and at GitHub for developers.

  \item \textbf{Research and development}: the main intent of this work was to do scientific programming driven by mathematical viewpoints and that is what we have tried to capture along this work. Satisfactory level of correctness achieved despite the lack of good theoretical sources. Need for several iterations to get algorithms right. Most of them are an original work.

  \item \textbf{Versatility}: not excesively hard mathematics, but they certainly require skills in different areas: graphs, linear algebra, probability or programming (R and C++ languages).

  \item \textbf{Lots of complementary work}: reading someone else's software and sending updates to CRAN (need to comply with guidelines and standards of that repository).
 \end{itemize}
